    <h1 class="title">The Visit</h1>
    <div class="info">Thu 14 April 2016</div>

    <p>I was a very successful bussiness man till today, till this exact moment. I always feared that my past would visit me. My past will be the reason for my fall.</p>
<p>But I was wrong, very wrong. Now My future haunts me. And now When I know what I will do, I really feel that my past was way better.</p>
<p>I feel dazed when I see myself standing before me. I am young, in my mid-20s and the person before me is 30 years older, has my same exact face, features and attitude. The only difference is that he has flanks of white hair in his jet black hair.</p>
<p>He has told me moments ago that I will become the worst hated man in the future. And also scientifically most successful. I would win four Nobel Prizes Three in physics and one in chemistry. But then I would create the most destructive weapon in the universe, An annihilation bomb. The combination of Anti-matter and matter, creating energy far beyond the scope of nuclear reactions used in Nuclear bombs. And I would explode three of them. Wiping half of the population of earth, destroying most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>What he next told me was the current issue for worrying. The countries that were left by the explosion took pledge to destroy me and my every research. They formed a syndicate to exterminate from the face of the world. They had all the scientists left after the D day. But I was also a one man Army. I created the elixir for immortality that allowed me to escape all the attempts made to assassinate me. But soon they figured my immortality So, they created a time machine, Using my own theories to kill me before I could be immortal.</p>
